Building:
When you open as a CMake project with Visual Studio, you must right-click the CMakeLists.txt in the root directory and
select "CMake Settings for vulkan_guide" and then you must set the "SDL2_dir" to the corresponing directory of SDL2. 
The root directory, not the include/libs directory inside the SDL2 folder.

Coordinate System:
- Right-Handed
- +Z is up
- Camera's view matrix contains the magic that makes most of the rendering just work

Buffers:
- Push Constants
  - Performant
  - Simple to use 
    - Does NOT require a Vulkan allocated buffer
      - Simply pass a pointer to data through vkCmdPushConstants()
  - Small amount of data (Max size on RTX 3060 is 256 bytes)
  - When used for a specific pipeline, that pipeline's layout must have declared a compatible push constant range which simply defines shader stage, size, and offset into the push constant.
  - Data must follow GLSL std430 layout
- Uniform Buffers
  - Performant
  - Buffer bound to a shader through pipelineLayout
  - Medium amount of data (Max size on RTX 3060 is 65536 bytes)
- Dynamic Uniform Buffers
- Storage Buffers


TODO:
- Minimizing breaks app
- Dynamically create descritptor set layouts and vertex attribute information based on shader reflection
- Cache descriptor layouts
